# Architecture

How the SDK is built — the monorepo, the dependency graph, the zero-build dev flow, and how it
compiles for publishing. For the *design rationale* (why these packages, the custody model, the
roadmap), see **[SDK.md](../SDK.md)**.

## Monorepo layout

```
circuit-sdk/
  packages/
    x402/        the payment spine (402 → pay CIRC → retry · verify)     ← zero deps
    core/        http · config (DI) · ed25519 identity · types           ← zero deps
    inference/   OpenAI-compatible DLLM client
    data/        typed Circuit Data API client
    wallet/      SOL/CIRC ops + Jupiter swaps          (+ @solana/web3.js)
    agent/       CircuitAgent + off-box custody + scaffold + bin
    node/        mesh control plane + public registry clients
    onchain/     StakePoint stake + CIRC balance (pure RPC)
    sdk/         meta-package — re-exports all
  circuit-py/    Python consume client (inference + data + x402)         ← stdlib only
  SDK.md         the design spec
  docs/          this documentation
```

npm workspaces (`packages/*`). `circuit-py` sits outside the workspace (it's Python).

## Dependency graph

**x402 is the spine; everything paid depends on it. Everything depends on core.** The arrows are
"depends on":

```
        core ──────────────────────────────┐   (http · config · identity · types)
         ▲   ▲                               │
   ┌─────┘   └────────┐                      │
 x402            wallet (+solana)            │   (x402 = payment spine; wallet implements PaymentWallet)
  ▲  ▲  ▲              ▲                      │
  │  │  └──── onchain ─┘ (core only)          │
  │  └──── data ───┐                          │
  └──── inference ─┤                          │
                   ▼                          │
              agent ───────────────────────── ┘   (composes inference + data + custody)
                   ▲
              node (core only)

  sdk = meta (re-exports everything) · circuit-py = independent Python port
```

Two packages — **`@circuit/x402`** and **`@circuit/core`** — have **zero runtime dependencies**. Only
`@circuit/wallet` pulls anything heavy (`@solana/web3.js`, `@solana/spl-token`, `bs58`), so consumers who
just want inference + data never install Solana.

---

## Zero-build dev, compiled publishing

The trick that keeps development build-free while shipping real JavaScript: **conditional exports** plus
**Node 22's native TypeScript type-stripping**.

Each package declares:

```jsonc
"exports": {
  ".": {
    "development": "./src/index.ts",   // dev / tests / typecheck resolve here
    "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",      // editors + consumers get the .d.ts
    "default": "./dist/index.js"       // published consumers run the compiled JS
  }
}
```

- **Development** — tests, typecheck, and cross-package imports resolve to `src/*.ts`. Node runs them
  directly with `--experimental-strip-types --conditions=development` (no transpile step); `tsc` resolves
  the same condition via `customConditions: ["development"]` in `tsconfig.base.json`. **No build needed
  to develop or test.**
- **Consumers** — without the `development` condition, imports resolve to the compiled `dist/*.js` + the
  `.d.ts`. A package A that imports B resolves B's `dist` too, so a published install is all JavaScript.

This is why `npm test` runs straight off TypeScript and a consumer still gets clean compiled output.

---

## Build & publish

```bash
npm run build      # each package: tsup src/index.ts → dist/index.js (ESM) + dist/index.d.ts
```

- **tsup** (esbuild) bundles each package's `src` into one ESM file, externalizing workspace deps and
  node builtins; a bundled `.d.ts` is emitted alongside.
- `@circuit/agent` also builds its `bin/circuit-agent.ts` → `dist/circuit-agent.js` (shebang preserved),
  wired as the `circuit-agent` bin.
- `dist/` is git-ignored; `prepack` rebuilds it, so `npm publish --workspaces` always ships fresh JS +
  types. `files: ["dist"]` keeps the published tarball to compiled output only.

`circuit-py` builds with `hatchling` (`pyproject.toml`).

---

## Testing

```bash
npm test            # 81 TS tests across all packages, zero-transpile (node:test + strip-types)
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit on all 9 packages (strict + noUncheckedIndexedAccess)
cd circuit-py && python3 -m unittest discover -s tests   # 12 Python tests
```

Tests use the stdlib `node:test` runner and inject fakes — a stub `fetch`, a fake `PaymentWallet`, an
in-memory filesystem, an injectable clock — so the entire suite runs **offline, with no network, no
Solana, and no real signer.** That's a deliberate design constraint: every client takes its transport,
wallet, connection, and clock as injectable dependencies.

---

## Two identity schemes

The SDK reproduces both ed25519 identities the ecosystem uses — they are **not** interchangeable:

| | `@circuit/core` `Identity` | `@circuit/node` `MeshIdentity` |
|---|---|---|
| Used by | the public node registry | the inference-mesh control plane |
| `nodeId` | SPKI/DER public key, base64 | raw public key, hex |
| Signing | `X-Node-*` headers; `canonicalPayload(nodeId, ts, body)` | `node_id`+`ts` in the body; `sig` over compact sorted-JSON of body-minus-sig |

Both match the live servers byte-for-byte (verified by round-trip tests against the real
`control_server.py` signer/verifier). See [contributing-a-node.md](./contributing-a-node.md).

---

## Conventions

- **ESM-first**, `"type": "module"`, NodeNext resolution, Node ≥ 22.
- **TypeScript strict** + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`; type-only imports use `import type` (required by
  type-stripping — a value-import of an interface fails to link at runtime).
- **Dependency injection over singletons** — no global config, no hardcoded `~/.circuit` paths. Every
  effectful boundary (fetch, RPC, fs, clock, wallet) is injectable, which is what makes the suite
  offline-testable.
- **Faithful extraction** — the consume clients, the x402 flow, the custody contract, and the mesh
  protocol are ported from the live ecosystem (`circuit-cli`, `circuit-agent-cloud`, `circuit-data-api`,
  `circuit-dllm`, `circuit-node-client`), not reinvented.
